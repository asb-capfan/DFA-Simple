0.32

    - Until version 0.32 the action table had a small bug. 
	  The third element of the Actions array was employ as the code ref to be run when leaving a state. 
	  This is still supported for backwards compatibility, but is deprecated. 
	  The documentation specified the second element is to hold the action. 
	  This is now used (it was ignored before), and if not set, the third element is checked.
